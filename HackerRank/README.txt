3. CompareTriplets.c

Sample Input 0

5 6 7
3 6 10
Sample Output 0

1 1
=============================

4. Grading problem

Sample Input 0

4
73
67
38
33
Sample Output 0

75
67
40
33
Explanation 0

Student 1  received a 73, and the next multiple of 5 from 73 is 75 . Since 75-73<3 , the student's grade is rounded to 75.
Student 2 received a 67, and the next multiple of 5 from 67 is 70 . Since 70-67 = 3, the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 67.
Student 3 received a 38, and the next multiple of 5 from 38 is 40. Since 40-38 < 3, the student's grade will be rounded to 40.
Student 4 received a grade below 33, so the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is 33.
================================

5. MinMaxSump.c

Sample Input
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

10 14
Explanation

The numbers are 1,2 ,3 ,4  and 5 . Calculate the following sums using four of the five integers:

Sum everything except 1, the sum is 2+3+4+5= 14 .
Sum everything except , the sum is 1+3+4+5=13.
Sum everything except , the sum is 1+2+4+5=12.
Sum everything except , the sum is 1+2+3+5=11.
Sum everything except , the sum is 1+2+3+4=10.

6.PlusMinus.cpp

Sample Input

6
-4 3 -9 0 4 1
Sample Output

0.500000
0.333333
0.166667
Explanation

There are 3 positive numbers, 2 negative numbers, and 1 zero in the array.
The proportions of occurrence are positive: 3/6 = 0.500000, negative: 2/6= 0.333333 and zeros: 1/6=0.166667 .
